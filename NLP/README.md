NLP Project Report
Project Objection:
Sentiment Analysis is an important element when it comes to natural language processing (NLP). In this project, we will try to apply sentiment analysis on an iMDb comment dataset from utils to see our modelâ€™s ability on sentiment analysis, where both traditional machine learning methods, like Native Bayes, and deep NLP methods, like Deep LSTM and RNN, will be applied.
Background Introduction:
	In this project, we will be introduced to natural language processing from the basic to the deep, starting from (1) using the simplest model, Multinomial Native Bayes, to build a complete pipeline for solving sentiment analysis problem, to (2) the view of word embedding and neural network by applying a simple 2-layer network for classification to words in the numerical form, to (3) build a deep LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network and how to insert a fixed pre-trained embedding layer in Keras.
	A new Python package will be introduced called utils. And load IMDB dataset from utils for our model.
